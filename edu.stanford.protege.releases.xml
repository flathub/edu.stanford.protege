            <p>Summary</p>
            <p>This release provides the option to download Prot&#233;g&#233; with a Java Runtime Environment.  Users should pick the release that is specific for their platform.</p>
            <p>New functionality</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Added "Reload" menu item to the File menu.  Select "Reload" from the File menu or press Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on a Mac) to reload the active ontology.  If the ontology has been modified but not saved then a warning is shown.  (#152)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other changes</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Prot&#233;g&#233; GitHub repository no longer contains jars for felix and equinox.  These are now pulled from Maven Central. (#157, #158 and #159)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This release contains a number of bug fixes and enhancements:</p>
            <p>
                <em>Functionality enhancements:</em>
            </p>

                <li>Upgraded to the OWL API version 3.5.1 (#91)</li>
                <li>Made some improvements to search (Thanks go to David Osumi-Sutherland @dosumis and EBI colleagues for making useful suggestions!) (#87)</li>
                <li>Support extra menu items in the reasoner menu (Thanks go to Simon Spero  @sesuncedu)</li>
                <li>Changed the search field so that pressing backspace in the empty search field hides the search popup (#140)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <em>UI enhancements:</em>

            <ul>
                <li>Renamed "Members" section to "Instances" (#110)</li>
